# DigitalVoxEffect
This repository is mainly used to save some effect gifs obtained by *DigitalVox*.

*DigitalVox* is the name of a series. Although each version is based on a component system, the specific implementation is
very different. Therefore, different code repositories are used for management. Please obtain the code you need on
demand:

1. DigitalVox2: Engine written in Swift, 3rd party library bridged by Objective-C++.
2. DigitalVoxEffect: Engine developed in C++, based on the math library provided by Ozz.
3. **[DigitalVox4](https://github.com/yangfengzzz/DigitalVox4)** : This engine is based on C++, and the underlying
   mathematical library is templated to support the precision requirements of rendering and physical simulation at the
   same time. The rendering layer abstraction for Metal makes it possible to use the C++ compiler instead of
   Objective-C++ globally, and encapsulates GLFW events to achieve cross-platform. Further, clean up the component
   system and eliminate the global dependency. And make the rendering pipeline independent of the camera, so it is
   easier to customize the rendering pipeline.

## Features

### GLTF Loader

[Example](https://github.com/yangfengzzz/DigitalVox4/blob/master/apps/gltf_app.cpp) about GLTF Loader which based
on [GLTF](https://github.com/syoyo/tinygltf)
![GLTF Scene](https://github.com/yangfengzzz/DigitalVoxEffect/raw/main/doc/img/gltf_scene.gif "GLTF Scene")

### GPU Skinning Animation with GLTF

[Example](https://github.com/yangfengzzz/DigitalVox4/blob/master/apps/scene_animation_app.cpp) can also load animation which
control the tree of entities. GPU Skinning Animation limit the joint weight have only four component.

### CPU Animation System with FBX

[Example](https://github.com/yangfengzzz/DigitalVox4/blob/master/apps/animation_app.cpp) about CPU animation system which
is based on [OZZ-Animation](https://github.com/guillaumeblanc/ozz-animation). Ozz support CPU skinning, blending, IK and
other animation ability. The CPU animation system does not limit the number of weights of the bones, so it will be more
free to use.

### Physics System

[Example](https://github.com/yangfengzzz/DigitalVox4/blob/master/apps/physx_dynamic_app.cpp) about Physics System which
is based on [PhysX](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX). Collider, Joint, Character Controller are all wrapped as
component which is more easy to use.

### PBR

[Example](https://github.com/yangfengzzz/DigitalVox4/blob/master/apps/ibl_app.cpp) use IBL to render basic pbr scene.
The specular-map is generated by using compute shader. The diffuse-map is generated
by [Model I/O framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/modelio/mdltexture/1391909-irradiancetexturecubewithtexture/)

### Shadow System

[Example](https://github.com/yangfengzzz/DigitalVox4/blob/master/apps/shadowmap_app.cpp) support multi-shadow from three
kind of lights. All these based on ShadowMap.

1. spot light: single shadow map
2. directional light: cascaded shadow map(render four times)
3. point light: shadow cube map (render six times)

![Multi Shadow](https://github.com/yangfengzzz/DigitalVoxEffect/raw/main/doc/img/multi_shadow.gif "Multi Shadow")
![Cube Shadow from Point](https://github.com/yangfengzzz/DigitalVoxEffect/raw/main/doc/img/cube_shadow.gif "Cube Shadow from Point")

### GUI

[Editor](https://github.com/yangfengzzz/DigitalVox4/blob/master/editor/gui_entry.h) use IMGUI to render gui
and [FrameBuffer Picker](https://github.com/yangfengzzz/DigitalVoxEffect/blob/master/apps/framebuffer_picker_app.cpp) to link
the scene with panel. [ImGuizmo](https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/ImGuizmo)
and [imgui-node-editor](https://github.com/thedmd/imgui-node-editor) build the basic infrastructure of editor.
