## Features

### GLTF Loader

[Example](https://github.com/ArcheGraphics/SwiftArche/blob/main/SwiftArcheMac/loader/GLTFViewerApp.swift) about GLTF Loader

### GPU Skinning Animation with GLTF

[Example](https://github.com/ArcheGraphics/SwiftArche/blob/main/SwiftArcheMac/loader/GLTFViewerApp.swift) can also load animation
which control the tree of entities. GPU Skinning Animation limit the joint weight have only four component.

### Physics System

[Example](https://github.com/ArcheGraphics/SwiftArche/tree/main/SwiftArcheMac/physics) about Physics System which
is based on [PhysX](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX). Collider, Joint, Character Controller are all wrapped as
component which is more easy to use.

### PBR

[Example](https://github.com/ArcheGraphics/SwiftArche/blob/main/SwiftArcheMac/rendering/PBRApp.swift) use IBL to render basic pbr scene.
The specular-map is generated by using compute shader.

### Shadow System

[Example](https://github.com/ArcheGraphics/SwiftArche/blob/main/SwiftArcheMac/rendering/CascadeShadowApp.swift) support multi-shadow from three
kind of lights. All these based on ShadowMap.

1. spot light: single shadow map
2. directional light: cascaded shadow map(render four times)
3. point light: shadow cube map (render six times)
